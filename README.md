# zindi-early-learning-predictors-py


## Motivation




See here: [https://zindi.africa/competitions/datadrive2030-early-learning-predictors-challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/datadrive2030-early-learning-predictors-challenge).


## Approach

Just a brief description. 



## Reproducibility

The repository includes all necessary data. A `requirements.txt` is included to reproduce the environment that was used to run the included notebooks. All analyses were done in Python `v3.10.11`.

Order in which to run code
Explanations of features used
Environment for the code to be run (conda environment.yml file or an environment.txt file)
Hardware needed (e.g. Google Colab or the specifications of your local machine)
Expected run time for each notebook. This will be useful to the review team for time and resource allocation.
